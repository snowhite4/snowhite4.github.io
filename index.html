<h2 style="color:white;font-size:20;text-align:center">Personal Information<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My name is Chris, I am 29 and I live on the central coast of New South Wales,
  I work full time as a collection agent and am currently pursuing further education in the field of Information Technology,
  My hobbies are my cat “newton” and my car “Bruce”, I also play some old school video games In my free time such as far cry 3 and fallout 4,
  I like the older games I find that newer games lack the substance.<p></body>

<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Interest in IT<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My interest in IT comes from my youth as when I was younger computer’s were just becoming mainstream in households as well as things such as game consoles etc.
  In year 10 we studied basic html and robotics,
  just simple stuff such as uploading a program into a robot.
  My interest was further piqued in one of my occupations in manufacturing where we used and worked along aside robots,
  these robots were built for the industry however did need to be programmed still whilst I wasn’t responsible for this,
  we did use the “controller “when they would get stuck inside the machines to free them.
  My interest for IT also comes from recent years and watching IT become more influential in every aspect of our lives,
  I thought to myself I would like to be involved in that and that was what spurred me into studying IT,
  I think also that in the future IT will be defining in how we as a civilisation evolve and how we evolve.
  One thing that still interests me to this day is the scope upon what IT is becoming involved in,
  everything from warfare to health IT is helping industries become more effective.
  I chose RMIT as i is an industry leader when it comes to technology certification, 
  and I believe that by studying at RMIT I am allowing myself to be highly employable In the IT field. 
  I expect to learn the fundamentals of both information technologies and programming,
  from what programs the industry uses to learning strategies to improve my knowledge base.<p>
