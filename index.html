<h2 style="color:white;font-size:20;text-align:center">Personal Information<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My name is Chris, I am 29 and I live on the central coast of New South Wales,
  I work full time as a collection agent and am currently pursuing further education in the field of Information Technology,
  My hobbies are my cat “newton” and my car “Bruce”, I also play some old school video games In my free time such as far cry 3 and fallout 4,
  I like the older games I find that newer games lack the substance.I grew up in a south coast town called Moruya,
  after I finished my HSC, I moved to Wollongong and worked as a security guard before getting work overseas in Africa as an armed guard in Kenya and Rwanda,
  I worked in two contracts for 3 years after which I got more work in the Philippines in the same capacity.
<br>
<br>
<br>
  After returning to Australia, I worked in several call centres, one of which was stellar Asia Pacific, a large contact centre for Telstra.
  After this I worked at Australian Debt recoveries as a debt collector,
  I liked this position as it took into account some of my previous skills such as finding debtors and searching for them through use of tools such as the internet.
  I have worked for companies such as radio rentals for repossession of goods and other companies as a mercantile agent. About a year and a 
  half ago I opened a computer business in port kembla where I was repurposing computers and equipment from sites like gumtree etc, however due to covid I had to stop this endeavour.
  About six  months ago I moved from Wollongong to the central coast and am taking the time to study and look for a new career path as I would like to do something different and feel my passion for computers and IT would
  best be served in such a profession. My biggest passion would be my car, his nickname is bruce, after the movie bruce almighty, It is a modified bmw e90 with a stage three manifold
  and upgraded air system, its my pride and joy however during studying hard for uni classes he gets a bit neglected.).
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I don’t have many skills that translate into raw computer skills,
  in fact I spent an entire weekend learning html and CSS just so I could make this webpage,. My preferred career in this field would be a cyber security analyst or advisor
  as I believe this particular aspect of the IT industry will become more important in years to come and it would be challenging work.
  just in these past few weeks I have learnt a lot and am looking forward to improving my skills in the It field.<p>

<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Interest in IT<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My interest in IT comes from my youth as when I was younger computers were just becoming mainstream in households
  as well as things such as game consoles etc. as well as sci fi movies a few in particular was “terminator” and “Independence Day. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
In year 10 we studied basic html and robotics,
  just simple stuff such as uploading a program into a robot. My interest was further piqued in one of my occupations in manufacturing 
  where we used and worked along aside robots, these robots were built for the industry however did need to be programmed still whilst I wasn’t responsible for this,
  we did use the “controller “when they would get stuck inside the machines to free them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 I have experience in business online, part of my business involved ordering parts from India with payment in cryptocurrency 
  so that improved my knowledge base whilst also giving me an insight into that aspect of the web.
  My interest for IT also comes from recent years and watching IT become more influential in every aspect of our lives, 
  I thought to myself I would like to be involved in that and that was what spurred me into studying IT,
  I think also that in the future IT will be defining in how we as a civilisation evolve and how we evolve as people. 
  One thing that still interests me to this day is the scope upon what IT is becoming involved in, 
  everything from warfare to health IT is helping industries become more effective.
  I chose RMIT as It is the industry leader when it comes to technology certification, 
  and I believe that by studying at RMIT I am allowing myself to be highly employable In the IT field.
  I expect to learn the fundamentals of both information technologies and programming,
  from what programs the industry uses to learning strategies to improve my knowledge base, 
  I also want to learn how to build and maintain applications so I can design one to place on the google app store(kind of a life goal).
  I don’t have many skills that translate into raw computer skills,
  in fact I spent an entire weekend learning html and CSS just so I could make this webpage,
  just in these past few weeks I have learnt a lot.

<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Outline:<h2>
<p style="color:white;font-size:12pt">I think would be a good job for me as it allows me to show my ability in security as well as IT, 
  The jobs requires you be proactive when it comes to security concerns, work with internal stakeholders in implementing decisions and security protocols.
It also requires you to work collaboratively and respond to issues that arise in regard to technologies security.It would be important to consider also that you would
  be looking after the servers and other components of the company, also liasing with staff and other people in the organisation to improve and monitor the system.<p>
<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Requirements:<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">The jobs requirement are a tertiary level education in a related field, or through certification with CISSP or SANS,
also requires four years of relevant experience in finance or insurance as well as experience with Endpoint.
,Firewalls,Cloud Proxy Solution(Zscaler or Netskope) and experience working with AWS.<p>
<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Steps needed<h3>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">First of all, completeing my degree would put in a good position to engage with this employer, also my years of experience in the debt collection feild would count towards the
four years needed in finance. Taking some other courses such as courses offered through coursera or other online providers aswell as getting certification with SANS or CISSP,
researching myself at home about programs such as Endpoint would see my chances improve, also some potential volunteer work would make my resume look better.<p>

<h3 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">The Architect<h3>
<h3 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Strengths<h3>
<p style="color:white;font-size:12pt">The strengths of the architect primarily centre aroung cognitive response and approach to solving problems,
one such strength is being strongly independent.
Another strength of the architect is being easy going and able to adapt they also are confident in their skills and approach new tasks with out of the box solutions.<p>
<h4 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Weaknesses<h4>
<p style="color:white;font-size:12pt">Weaknesses of the Architect revolve around feeling mainly the lack thereof, Architect's have problem making decisions based on feelings and don't understand the importance of
such decisions. Another weakness is social interaction, they feel the need to keep their work and idea's to themselves, they tend to place high expectations on themselves and 
others around, so much so they seem critical towards others.<p>

<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">IT Project<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My project is based on a real time life monitor for use in combat scenarios and military deployment worldwide
  and send back real time data on vital signs such as heartrate, blood pressure and oxygen stats. 
  The vitals signs would be taken by use of monitoring equipment such as heart rate monitors and oximeters and provide a benchmark 
  on which to triage soldiers in trouble into different categories depending on the severity of their condition,
  the device would small enough so as not to interfere with the soldier’s duty, 
  the device could be used to determine whether or not the soldier was in difficulty such as suffocating or bleeding out. 
  <br>
  <br>
  \The main hardware for this project would be wearable technology similar to an arm band or a Fitbit that would display to a commander 
  or monitor at base camp how the soldier is travelling allowing people
  at the monitoring centre or field base to dispatch appropriate care such as medevac units or more combat units.
  The device would have ballistic elements such as being explosion proof and tamper proof to stop enemies from using the technology against the utiliser.
  It would also include an emergency button to enable the user to send an instant alert to base requesting assistance.
  The device would also have protection against dust and other protections that would allow it to function effectively on the battlefield,
  this is an important aspect of the device as dust could potentially cause the device
  to malfunction and assign vital military resources to a situation where there is nothing wrong. 
  The technology would add to the commander’s ability to conduct warfare and reduce his death ratios
  and also improve the ability to respond to emergencies with an appropriate solution. 
  It would also provide a notification service to notify the commander’s/monitors about a potentially life-threatening situation. 
  The device would also be used to understand a unit/platoon’s ability to operate in any environment and provide the statistical analysis required
  for better battlefield management. 
<br>
<br>
  The main concept behind the device would be after a traumatic event to the user, 
  the device would then send an encrypted communication via satellite or internet to the commander or life-signs monitor who would then from the available monitoring options
  (tablet, laptop) receive the transmission and evaluate it, they would then be able to assign a rescue team or medevac unit to rush to the scene to help the user,
  another implementation is the monitoring device would register the alerts and triage them into categories so that the person monitoring could evaluate which user’s 
  to help first. I believe the device would be beneficial in certain situations better than other’s such as if the user is attacked suddenly by a hidden element 
  and it is not seen by his immediate platoon. It would also be useful to pilots if they downed and forced to spend the night in the wilderness. 
<br>
Advantages:
<br>
<br>
•	Better response to emergency situations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
•	A more in depth understanding of a unit/platoon’s physiology in real time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
•	Real time updates on health and vital signs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
•	Better statistical analysis of the battlefield 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Disadvantages:
<br>
<br>
•	Potential to fall into enemy hands and trigger false emergency situations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
•	Potentially provide misleading data
<br>
<br>
<br>
A good example for the use of the device would be the 2002 battle of Takur Ghar, in which American Navy Seals were ambushed by Al Qaeda, the command didn’t know the situation
  on the ground and sent 3 chinook helicopters that were subsequently shot down. If the device would have been present and performed to expected capability, 
  the command would have been notified of the American’s dire situation and been able to come up with a solution instead of sending more soldiers and equipment
  into the situation without this data, possibly changing the outcome.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My motivation to create this product is one, help military personnel in the field and stop them dying from potentially avoidable scenarios
  the other is to get my foot in the door of military IT and development so that I can create my own defence contracting company,
  I believe that this technology with allow further improvements to the monitoring of soldiers in the field. I also think that the technology would inspire
  greater attention towards care and maintenance within the armed forces and promote better attention to detail for medical evacuation procedures.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The technology required to build the device and monitor is effectively include both software and hardware,
  the hardware would be the device itself (a wearable arm band), a communication system to send real time results back to the base and a monitoring device such as a tablet
  or computer to view the information being relayed by the device. The software used to help the device communicate would be C++ for the initial framework
  of the device and Java to create the network. The monitoring device would contain C++ code for the framework of the system and run the necessary monitoring functions.
  Another progamming language that would be beneficial to use would be Ada as it is highly reliable. This software would consist of two programs, 
  one a program for the device to store and package data taken from the device’s range of measuring tools (heart rate monitor and oximeters), 
  the other would be for the monitoring system to receive and analyse/triage the user’s information. The communications system would use a closed frequency
  to ensure the communications are encrypted and unable to be intercepted. The device would use a long-range transmission (UHF band)
  frequency to be able to communicate over long distances, either by using a satellite or communication towers, 
  the transmission is crucial as this is what allows the device to function effectively so an emphasis on speed is paramount.
<br>
<br>
<br>
  Other technology would be ballistic material for the device itself and a tamper system to ensure the technology does not fall into the wrong hands.
  A system for incorporating a panic button function, such as a two-stage input to reduce the number of errors made with the panic button.
  The device would also have machine learning so that the system can pick up on different aspects of the battlefield,
  learn to assign variables and notify the monitor of the user’s situation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Skill required to build this device would be proficiency in coding ability such as C++ and Java and understanding and knowledge or access to information 
  of communication systems as well as encoding a signal so that it can be identified on the appropriate network. 
  Other skills would be knowledge or access to information on how to build a communication system that can work at long distance
  . Knowledge on how to build or augment electronics to suit the desired purpose including the implementation of the device into a soldier’s loadout and
  the best way to build the device the device so it doesn’t become an encumbrance or obstacle. I also think knowledge of a combat or hostile environment
  is valuable as you can assign more variables to what the device can pick up and what to ignore.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The outcome of the device and its program would be a more sophisticated military and the ability to monitor assets in the field and be able to respond appropriately faster
  and more efficiently, one positive outcome the program would present is a reduction in casualties and promote a better safety environment for soldiers. 
  The project could very well have other applications in other fields and potentially lead to other breakthrough tech. 
  The use of this technology would have great benefits for any armed force operating anywhere in the world and would reduce the incidents that could
  be avoided by conventional approaches. The outcome for the individual user is better monitoring of their vitals and increased potentially increased confidence i
  n operating in the field as soldiers would feel better about their situation being watched more intently.
