<h2 style="color:white;font-size:20;text-align:center">Personal Information<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My name is Chris, I am 29 and I live on the central coast of New South Wales,
  I work full time as a collection agent and am currently pursuing further education in the field of Information Technology,
  My hobbies are my cat “newton” and my car “Bruce”, I also play some old school video games In my free time such as far cry 3 and fallout 4,
  I like the older games I find that newer games lack the substance.I grew up in a south coast town called Moruya,
  after I finished my HSC, I moved to Wollongong and worked as a security guard before getting work overseas in Africa as an armed guard in Kenya and Rwanda,
  I worked in two contracts for 3 years after which I got more work in the Philippines in the same capacity.
  After returning to Australia, I worked in several call centres, one of which was stellar Asia Pacific, a large contact centre for Telstra.
  After this I worked at Australian Debt recoveries as a debt collector,
  I liked this position as it took into account some of my previous skills such as finding debtors and searching for them through use of tools such as the internet.
  I have worked for companies such as radio rentals for repossession of goods and other companies as a mercantile agent. About a year and a 
  half ago I opened a computer business in port kembla where I was repurposing computers and equipment from sites like gumtree etc, however due to covid I had to stop this endeavour.
  About six  months ago I moved from Wollongong to the central coast and am taking the time to study and look for a new career path as I would like to do something different and feel my passion for computers and IT would
  best be served in such a profession. My biggest passion would be my car, his nickname is bruce, after the movie bruce almighty, It is a modified bmw e90 with a three stage manifold
  and upgraded air system, its my pride and joy however during studying hard for uni classes he gets a bit neglected.). I don’t have many skills that translate into raw computer skills,
  in fact I spent an entire weekend learning html and CSS just so I could make this webpage,
  just in these past few weeks I have learnt a lot and am looking forward to improving my skills in the It field.<p>

<h2 style="color:white;font size:20;text-align:center">Interest in IT<h2>
<p style="color: white;font-size:12pt">My interest in IT comes from my youth as when I was younger computer’s were just becoming mainstream in households as well as things such as game consoles etc.
  In year 10 we studied basic html and robotics,
  just simple stuff such as uploading a program into a robot.
  My interest was further piqued in one of my occupations in manufacturing where we used and worked along aside robots,
  these robots were built for the industry however did need to be programmed still whilst I wasn’t responsible for this,
  we did use the “controller “when they would get stuck inside the machines to free them.
  My interest for IT also comes from recent years and watching IT become more influential in every aspect of our lives,
  I thought to myself I would like to be involved in that and that was what spurred me into studying IT,
  I think also that in the future IT will be defining in how we as a civilisation evolve and how we evolve.
  One thing that still interests me to this day is the scope upon what IT is becoming involved in,
  everything from warfare to health IT is helping industries become more effective.
  I chose RMIT as i is an industry leader when it comes to technology certification, 
  and I believe that by studying at RMIT I am allowing myself to be highly employable In the IT field, another reason I chose RMIT is its emphasis
  on technology, after I am finished studying my degree in IT, I would like to maybe do robotics. 
  I expect to learn the fundamentals of both information technologies and programming,
  from what programs the industry uses to learning strategies to improve my knowledge base.
  I also want to learn how to build and maintain applications so I can design one to place on the google app store(kind of a life goal).<p>

<h3 style="color:white;font-size:16">Outline:<h3>
<br>
<p style="color:white;font-size:12">I think would be a good job for me as it allows me to show my ability in security as well as IT, 
  The jobs requires you be proactive when it comes to security concerns, work with internal stakeholders in implementing decisions and security protocols.
It also requires you to work collaboratively and respond to issues that arise in regard to technologies security.It would be important to consider also that you would
  be looking after the servers and other components of the company, also liasing with staff and other people in the organisation to improve and monitor the system.<p>
<br>
<h3 style="color:white;font-size:16">Requirements:<h3>
<br>
<p>The jobs requirement are a tertiary level education in a related field, or through certification with CISSP or SANS,
also requires four years of relevant experience in finance or insurance as well as experience with Endpoint.
,Firewalls,Cloud Proxy Solution(Zscaler or Netskope) and experience working with AWS.<p>
<h3 style="color:white;font-size:16">Steps needed<h3>
<p>First of all, completeing my degree would put in a good position to engage with this employer, also my years of experience in the debt collection feild would count towards the
four years needed in finance. Taking some other courses such as courses offered through coursera or other online providers aswell as getting certification with SANS or CISSP,
researching myself at home about programs such as Endpoint would see my chances improve, also some potential volunteer work would make my resume look better.

<h3 style="color:white;font-size:20">The Architect<h3>
<h3 style="color:white;font-size:20">Strengths<h3>
<p style="color:white;font-size:12">The strengths of the architect primarily centre aroung cognitive response and approach to solving problems,
one such strength is being strongly independent.
Another strength of the architect is being easy going and able to adapt they also are confident in their skills and approach new tasks with out of the box solutions.<p>
<h4 style="color:white;font-size:20">Weaknesses<h4>
<p style="color:white;font-size:20">Weaknesses of the Architect revolve around feeling mainly the lack thereof, Architect's have problem making decisions based on feelings and don't understand the importance of
such decisions. Another weakness is social interaction, they feel the need to keep their work and idea's to themselves, they tend to place high expectations on themselves and 
others around, so much so they seem critical towards others.<p>
